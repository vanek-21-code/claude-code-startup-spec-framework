# Roadmap Generator - Universal Implementation Planning

This module generates comprehensive implementation and deployment plans for any startup, creating executable roadmaps that Claude Code can follow for autonomous development and launch execution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Output Structure

Generates all files for the **10-deployment/** folder:

## ðŸš€ Output Generation Rules

### **File Population Logic**
1. **Analyze startup context** (business model, tech stack, scale, timeline)
2. **Select appropriate templates** based on startup type
3. **Populate variables** with startup-specific values
4. **Apply business logic rules** for customization
5. **Generate executable YAML** files for Claude Code processing

### **Cross-Reference Integration**
- **Dependencies**: Reference 01-foundation/ for business context
- **Technical Alignment**: Reference 02-architecture/ for scaling decisions
- **Feature Coordination**: Reference 03-features/ for development priorities
- **Business Rules**: Reference 07-business-rules/ for operational logic

### **Validation Requirements**
- **Timeline Feasibility**: Ensure realistic development timelines
- **Resource Alignment**: Match plans to available resources
- **Business Model Consistency**: Align all plans with revenue model
- **Technical Feasibility**: Ensure plans match technical capabilities

This roadmap generator creates comprehensive, executable implementation plans that guide startups from MVP development through successful scaling and ongoing operations.
