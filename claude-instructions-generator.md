# Claude Instructions Generator
## AI-Executable Repository Generation Instructions

This module generates the complete instruction set that Claude Code follows to autonomously create and populate startup specification repositories using the universal 00-10 folder structure.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Generation Principles

### **Sequential Processing Architecture**
Claude Code processes folders in strict numerical order (00â†’01â†’02...â†’10) with validation checkpoints between each phase.

### **Schema-Driven Validation**
Every generated file validates against corresponding schemas before proceeding to the next folder.

### **Cross-Reference Integrity**
All dependencies are mapped and validated to ensure no broken references.

  ERROR:
    description: "Significant issue requiring correction"
    examples: ["Feature validation failure", "Business rule conflicts"]
    action: "Attempt automatic resolution, escalate if failed"
  
  WARNING:
    description: "Minor issue that doesn't block processing"
    examples: ["Missing optional features", "Brand inconsistencies"]
    action: "Continue with notation, flag for review"
```
