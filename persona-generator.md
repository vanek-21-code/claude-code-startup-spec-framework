# Persona Generator Module

Universal user persona generation system that creates detailed, behavioral user profiles for any startup idea. Outputs structured YAML files for Claude Code processing.

## üéØ Purpose

Generates comprehensive user personas that drive feature development, business logic, and user experience decisions across all startup types.

## üìÅ Output Specifications

**Output Location**: `01-foundation/user-personas.yaml`
**Schema Validation**: `04-schemas/user-story.schema.json`
**File Format**: Structured YAML with behavioral specifications
**Processing Order**: Generated after business-model.yaml, before features
